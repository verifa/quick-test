# Problem Statement
This is our quick problem-solving test. We have provided a file (`input.json`) which contains an array of objects in JSON format. What we want is for you to split this file into two files `red.json` and `blue.json`. `red.json` should contain all of the objects from `input.json` where the `colour` attribute is `red`, and `blue.json` where `colour` is `blue`.

# Details
You are permitted to split the file through any method you like, although we would suggest that copy/pasting by hand is not a good idea.

There may be bonus points for using a method that is,
- Easily repeatable (e.g. if I change the content of `input.json` and want to split again)
- Quick
- Simple to maintain
