# Problem Statement
This is our quick problem-solving test. We have provided a file (`input.json`) which contains an array of objects in JSON format. What we want is for you to split this file into three different files,
- `red.json`: contain all of the objects from `input.json` where the `colour` attribute is `red`
- `blue.json`: contain all of the objects where the `colour` attribute is `blue`
- `other.json`: contain all of the objects where the `colour` attribute is any other value

These files should all be formatted as a JSON array (similar to `input.json`).

# Details
You are permitted to split the file through any method you like (any tool / programming language is permitted), although we would suggest that copy/pasting by hand is not a good idea.

There may be bonus points for using a method that is,
- Easily repeatable (e.g. if I change the content of `input.json` and want to split again)
- Quick
- Simple to maintain
